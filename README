ABOUT
     dsbmc-cli is a command-line client for DSBMD that provides a simple
     interface to query information about storage devices, and to send
     requests to mount, unmount and eject these.

INSTALLATION
     # git clone https://github.com/mrclksr/DSBMC-Cli.git
     # git clone https://github.com/mrclksr/libdsbmc.git
     # cd DSBMC-Cli && make install

USAGE
     dsbmc-cli -L event command [arg ...] ; [-L ...]
     dsbmc-cli -a [-U time] [[-L event command [arg ...]] ; [-L ...]]
     dsbmc-cli {-e | -m | -s | -u | -v speed} device
     dsbmc-cli {-e | -u} <mount point>
     dsbmc-cli -l
     dsbmc-cli [-h]

OPTIONS
     -L      Listen for event, and execute the command every time the event is
             received. Possible events are mount, unmount, add, and remove.
             The command must be terminated by a semicolon (‘;’) as a separate
             argument. Each event provides information about the device that
             can be accessed using the placeholders %d (device name), %l
             (volume label), %m (mount point) (only mount and unmount ), and
             %t (device type). A literal percent character (‘%’) must be
             escaped by a further ‘%’ character (“%%”).  Possible values for
             the device type (%t) are hdd, usbdisk, datacd, audiocd, dvd, vcd,
             svcd, mmc, mtp, and ptp.  The -L option can be given multiple
             times.

     -U      Auto-unmount. Try to unmount each automounted device every ‘time’
             seconds.

     -a      Automount. After mounting all devices presented by DSBMD,
             dsbmc-cli(1) waits for new devices added to the system, and
             mounts them.  In addition, the -L option can be specified for
             each event. If dsbmc-cli(1) automounts a device, it executes the
             command defined for the mount event.

     -e device, -e <mount point>
             Eject the given device or the device mounted on <mount point>

     -l      List all currently attached devices DSBMD supports.

     -m device
             Mount the given device.

     -s device
             The storage capacity of the given device is queried, and the
             media size, the number of used and free bytes are printed to
             stdout.

     -u device, -u <mount point>
             Unmount the given device or the device mounted on <mount point>

     -v speed device
             Set the reading speed of the given CD/DVD device.

EXAMPLES
   1 Automounting
     Just execute ‘dsbmc-cli -a’ or, if you wish, add the command ‘dsbmc-cli
     -a 2>/dev/null&’ to your shell's startup file, your display manager's
     startup file, or your ~/.xsession.  If you don't want to manually unmount
     your devices, you can in addition use the -U flag.

   1.1 Using dsbmc-cli together with fb-unmount
     If you're using Fluxbox, you might be interested in using the script
     ‘fb-unmount’, which automatically adds entries of mounted devices to your
     Fluxbox menu. This allows you to unmount and eject devices by clicking
     the corresponding menu entry:

     Get the script from
           https://github.com/mrclksr/fb-unmount,
     save it in ~/bin, and make it executable (chmod u+x ~/bin/fb-unmount).
     Finally add the following line(s) to your ~/.fluxbox/startup:

     dsbmc-cli -a -L mount fb-unmount -m %d %m ';' \
         -L unmount fb-unmount -u %d ';'&
