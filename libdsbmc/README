DESCRIPTION
     dsbmc_connect() must be called before any other dsbmc function. It
     establishes a connection to DSBMD, and returns 0 on success, and -1 if an
     error occured.

     The dsbmc_disconnect() function terminates the connection to DSBMD.

     The dsbmc_fetch_event() function fetches the next available event,
     updates internal data structures, and executes callback functions. If an
     event is available, dsbmc_fetch_event() returns a value > 0, else 0 is
     returned.  If an error occured, dsbmc_fetch_event() returns -1. Possible
     errors are DSBMC_ERR_LOST_CONNECTION, DSBMC_ERR_SYS and/or
     DSBMC_ERR_FATAL.  Instead of CPU intensive polling, dsbmc_fetch_event()
     can be used together with select() by passing the file descriptor
     retrieved by dsbmd_get_fd().

     The dsbmc_get_devlist() fucntion sets the given pointer to the internal
     list of dsbmc_dev_t * objects. The number of objects is returned.

     The dsbmc_get_fd() function returns the file descriptor of the socket
     which is connected to DSBMD. Its ONLY purpose is to use it with select().

     The dsbmc_mount() function mounts the device represented by the given
     object.  The function blocks until a reply from DSBMD is received or an
     error occured.  On success dsbmc_mount() returns 0. If mounting failed,
     an error code > 0 is returned, which can be one of
     DSBMC_ERR_ALREADY_MOUNTED, DSBMC_ERR_NO_MEDIA
     DSBMC_ERR_PERMISSION_DENIED, DSBMC_ERR_DEVICE_BUSY,
     DSBMC_ERR_NO_SUCH_DEVICE, DSBMC_ERR_UNKNOWN_FILESYSTEM,
     DSBMC_ERR_UNKNOWN_ERROR, DSBMC_ERR_MNTCMD_FAILED.  If an error occured,
     -1 is returned, and the error bitmask is set accordingly.

     The dsbmc_unmount() function unmounts the device represented by the given
     object. If 'force' is true, unmounting will be enforced even if the
     device is busy. The function blocks until a reply from DSBMD is received
     or an error occured. On success dsbmc_unmount() returns 0. If unmounting
     failed, an error code > 0 is returned, which can be
     DSBMC_ERR_NOT_MOUNTED, DSBMC_ERR_DEVICE_BUSY, or an errno number. If an
     error occured, -1 is returned, and the error bitmask is set accordingly.

     The dsbmc_eject() function ejects the device represented by the given
     object.  If 'force' is true, ejecting will be enforced even if the device
     is busy.  The function blocks until a reply from DSBMD is received or an
     error occured.  On success dsbmc_eject() returns 0. If ejecting failed,
     an error code > 0 is returned, which can be DSBMC_ERR_NOT_EJECTABLE,
     DSBMC_ERR_DEVICE_BUSY, or an errno number. If an error occured, -1 is
     returned, and the error bitmask is set accordingly.

     The dsbmc_set_speed() function sets the reading speed of the optical
     device represented by the given object. The function blocks until a reply
     from DSBMD is received or an error occured. On success dsbmc_set_speed()
     returns 0. If it failed, an error code > 0 is returned, which can be
     ERR_INVALID_ARGUMENT, or an errno number. If an error occured, -1 is
     returned, and the error bitmask is set accordingly.

     The dsbmc_size() function queries the storage capacity, the number of
     used and free bytes of the device represented by the given object.

     The _async() variant of dsbmc_mount(), dsbmc_unmount, dsbmc_eject, and
     dsbmc_set_speed() return 0, and the given callback function will be
     executed by dsbmd_fetch_event() as soon as a command-reply code is
     received. If an error occured, -1 is returned, and the error bitmask is
     set accordingly.

     If the DSBMC_EVENT_DEL_DEVICE event was received, the device object
     should be removed from the list using dsbmc_free_dev() if it is no longer
     needed.

     If one of the functions failed with an error, the function
     dsbmc_get_err() can be used to retrieve the error bitmask. If errstr is
     not NULL, it is set to the corresponding error message.

     The function dsbmc_errstr() returns the last error message.

     The dsbmc_errcode_to_str() function translates a DSBMD error-code into a
     string.

THREADS
     libdsbmc can be used together with threads. However, using multiple
     connections to DSBMD established by dsbmc_connect() is not supported.
     Special care must be taken when using dsbmc_free_dev() on multiple
     threads.

     dsbmc_get_err() returns the following error codes as bitmask:

     DSBMC_ERR_SYS      Syscall failed

     DSBMC_ERR_FATAL    Fatal error. Continuing the program is probably not
                        possible.

                        Connection to DSBMD lost.

     DSBMC_ERR_INVALID_DEVICE
                        A NULL pointer or a pointer to a removed device object
                        was passed.

     DSBMC_ERR_CMDQ_BUSY
                        The max. number of commands to be send asynchronously
