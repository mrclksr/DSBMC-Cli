Listen for
.Ar event ,
and execute the
.Ar command
every time the
.Em event
is received. Possible events are
.Em mount ,
.Em unmount ,
.Em add ,

.Em remove .
The
.Ar command
must be terminated by a semicolon
.Pq Sq \;
as a separate argument. Each event provides information about the device
that can be accessed using the placeholders
.Em %d
(device name),
.Em %l
(volume label),
.Em %m
(mount point) (only
.Em mount
and
.Em unmount
), and
.Em %t
(device type). A literal percent character
.Pq Sq %
must be escaped by a further
.Sq %
character
.Pq Dq %% .

Possible values for the device type
.Pq Em %t
are
.Em hdd , usbdisk , datacd , audiocd , dvd , vcd ,  svcd ,  mmc , mtp ,
and
.Em ptp .
